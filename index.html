        <p class="lead mb-4">An eager learner who doesn't back down at a challenge, I’m Valeria Hernandez and I think I would be an excellent choice to join your team. As far as skills go, I’m skilled in graphic design and am fluent in both English and Spanish. In short, I’m a dedicated worker who is passionate about what I do and can collaborate well with teammates. Along with my communication skills, I enjoy facing challenges head-on, efficiently, and effectively and am an exceptional problem solver. <br><br>
A few of my personal goals are to actively engage in the community I love and grew up in, along with enjoying life to the fullest and fulfilling my dreams since I was just a kid. I have plans to continually learn and better myself as I gain more experience with the thingsI enjoy most. 
My professional goals are to enter the film industry with objectives set in my mind and to be persistent, especially with the industry's challenges. Another goal of mine is to make an impact, like the many movies I enjoy.<br><br>  
At 18 years old some of my achievements trace back to before college. In high school, I participated in the International Baccalaureate and earned my medal at graduation. The achievements didn't stop there. In college, I've continued to be an active member of the Associated Students Program Board. As an honors student, my major is Theatre, Film, and Digital Production. My passion is to display themes that aren't frequently represented in the media. Whether those themes are the reality of attempting to "make it" in the land of the free or translating emotions onto the big screen, I love every moment. <br><br>
In long, I grew up in Southern California, in the city of San Bernardino with my two immigrant parents, and my brother. I enjoy everything San Bernardino and its neighboring cities have to offer. Whether it's long walks in the park with my childhood dog Pinky, on a warm summer day, or heading out to the beach to enjoy the cool breeze, I'm thankful for the community I grew up in. Other than the outdoors, I savor the vast expanse of small businesses located in the city. Whether it's a small coffee shop or a stationary store, I'm always sure to stop by when I have time. My other hobbies also include baking and film criticism.<br><br> 
But what I enjoy most is my family. My mother has inspired me from a young age to not only have kindness but to encourage others to have it too, a lesson I’m thankful to have. My father emphasized even if it seems like it doesn't, hard work does count, and that only you can make your dreams possible. To this day, I thank my parents who made everything possible for me. Without them, I  wouldn't have the opportunities I seek and the life I live. 
An important part of what makes up me, is the importance of giving back to the community I love so much. Along with working hard to support my ideals and beliefs. To this day I’m striving to reach my dreams and to join your team.
